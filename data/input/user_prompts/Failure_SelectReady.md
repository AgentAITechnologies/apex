You must now determine if you need additional information or need the opportunity to configure the state of the system before making another attempt at completing the task in a way such that the problem is rectified or the state of the system (or user, by way of passing a message) is configured such that the problem will not reoccur. Indicate your decision with a Markdown document that contains a level 1 heading (# ) "action" with text directly underneath indicating your decision. You may put the exact text "notready" to indicate that you need need more information or the opportunity to configure the state of the system (or user) before performing some other action that depends on this information or configuration to finish the task, or you may put the exact text "ready" to indicate that you are able to perform the task directly by writing a Python script, writing a PowerShell script, emulating mouse and keyboard input, or passing a message to the user as a final step itself. You may only put "ready" or "notready" on a new line after the heading "action", nothing else. In addition to this, include a level 2 heading (## ) "reason" that contains the reason why you have made this determination. Do not include any content besides the specified Markdown.
