You must now determine if you need additional information or need the opportunity to configure the state of the system before making another attempt at completing the main task "{task}" or whatever subtask you have just attempted to get or set the state of the system, its user, or some other aspect of your environment.

Indicate your decision with a Markdown document that contains a level 1 heading (# ) "action" with text directly underneath indicating your decision. You may put the exact text "notready" to indicate you must first get or set the state of the system, its user, or some other aspect of your environment before making another attempt at completing the main task "{task}" or your current subtask you just attempted to get or set state. In other words, indicate "notready" if there is anything you have to do set the necessary conditions for the successful completion of the main task "{task}" or the successful completion of any other necessary subtasks you intend to complete or have already attempted to complete by either configuring those conditions yourself or aquiring more necessary information. Alternatively, if all the conditions for a successful attemopt of the main task "{task}" are already met, you may put the exact text "ready" to indicate that you are able to perform the main task "{task}" directly by writing a Python script, writing a PowerShell script, emulating mouse and keyboard input, or passing a message to the user. You may only put "ready" or "notready" on a new line after the heading "action", nothing else. In addition to this, include a level 2 heading (## ) "reason" that contains the reason why you have made this determination. Do not include any content besides the specified Markdown.
