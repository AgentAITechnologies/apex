Do you need to get state (information about the system or its user) or set (configure) state of the system or its user, where configuring state of the user involves interacting with them?

Respond with a Markdown document indicating your decision. Write a level 1 heading (# ) with the exact text "action", directly followed on the next line by the exact text "getstate" if you need more information from the sysetm or user, or the exact text "setstate" if you need to configure the system or interact with the user. Follow this with a level 2 heading (## ) with the exact text "reason" directly followed by your reasoning for this decision.
