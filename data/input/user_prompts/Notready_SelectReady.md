Given the output of this attempt to configure the state of the system or user, do you think you are ready to directly complete the task "{task}", or do you need to make futher state changes to the system or user or need any additional information about the system, its user, or your environment?

Indicate your decision with a Markdown document that contains a level 1 heading (# ) "action" with text directly underneath indicating your decision. You may put the exact text "notready" to indicate that you need more information or the opportunity to configure the state of the system or user, or you may put the exact text "ready" to indicate that you are able to perform the task directly by writing a Python script, writing a PowerShell script, emulating mouse and keyboard input, or passing a message to the user. You may only put "ready" or "notready" on a new line after the heading "action", nothing else. In addition to this, include a level 2 heading (## ) "reason" that contains the reason why you have made this determination. Only choose keyboard and mouse input if you have no other feasible options. Do not include any content besides the specified Markdown.
