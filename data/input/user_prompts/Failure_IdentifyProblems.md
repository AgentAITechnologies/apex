Please respond with a Markdown document that contains a level 1 heading (# ) "problems" that conatins a comprehensive list of the problems on a new line under the heading. Each item in the list should be denoted by a level 2 heading (## ) followed by the name of the problem. For each problem with a level 2 heading, there should be a level 3 heading (### ) with the exact text "explanation" followed by an explanation and comprehensive description of the problem starting on the next line, and another level 3 heading (### ) with the exact text "implications" followed by a comprehensive description of any implications to consider as a result of encountering this problem starting on the next line.
