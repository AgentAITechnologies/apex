You got this result:

{result}

Does this result represent a successful attempt to get or set the state of the system, its user, or some other aspect of your environment? Determine if you were successful or not, considering the ENTIRE history of actions you have taken and their results. Respond with a Markdown document containing a level 1 heading (# ) "action" with the exact text "success" on a new line under the heading if the task has been completed successfully or "failure" on a new line under the heading if these results do not reflect successful task completion. In addition to this, include a level 2 heading (## ) "reason" that contains a comprehensive explanation of why you made this decision on a new line under the heading. If you select "failure", you may consider ways to complete the task that are outside the direct scope of the original request if those actions would allow you to complete the user's task, which you will have the opportunity to do later and with the user's permission. If the user's task or any possible solution is in fundamental conflict with any conditions specified by the user, you will have the opportunity to ask the user for clarification later.
