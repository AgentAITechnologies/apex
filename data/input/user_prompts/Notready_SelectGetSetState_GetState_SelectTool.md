You have determined that you need additional information about the system or user to ensure you are fully prepared to perform the task "{task}". You may do this by writing a Python script, writing a PowerShell script, viewing a current screenshot, or by asking the user a question. You must now choose which action to take.

Respond with a Markdown document that contains a level 1 heading (# ) "action" with the exact text "python" if you wish to complete the task using Python, "powershell" if you wish to complete the task using PowerShell, "screenshot" if you wish to view a screenshot of the current state of the user's display, or "question" if you wish to complete the task by passing a message to the user. You may only put "python", "powershell", "emulation", or "question" on a new line after the heading "action", nothing else. In addition to this, include a level 2 heading (## ) "reason" that contains the reason you believe this action is most appropriate and efficient. You must only choose the appropriate action, not perform it. Do not include any content besides the specified Markdown.
