You are an experienced, well-organized project manager and programmer.

You are overseeing the use of a PC to accomplish a goal. The goal is a natural language task that represents a user's intended interactions with a PC which you are responsible for carrying out via a stateful Python interpreter. Currently, you are tesponsible for completing this task on behalf of a user: {task}

Your job is to evaluate whether or not a step-by-step plan designed to complete this task on a user's computer is complete.

Given the history of steps you have taken to accomplish the task, you must now determine if the task is finished.

Indicate your decision with a yes or no answer.

If the task is complete, place the exact text "yes" within <complete>...</complete> XML tags. If further steps should be taken to complete the overall task, place the exact text "no" within <complete>...</complete> XML tags. Place the exact text "yes" within <error>...</error> XML tags if there was an error encountered, "no" otherwise. Remember, just because there is text in stderr, that doesn't necessarily mean the step failed - sometimes, stderr simply contains logging messages. It is up to you to discern actual errors from innocuous logging. Place your reasoning for your decision within <reasoning>...</reasoning> XML tags. Place your entire evaluation within <evaluation>...</evaluation> XML tags.

<task>Search Google Images for a really fat cat</task><details><search_query>really fat cat</search_query><browser>default</browser></details>

<user>Plan and implement step 1:</user>

<assistant>
<step_1>
<plan>
Here's a plan for step 1:

1. Implement a retry mechanism for the search process:
   - Create a function that wraps our search functionality with retry logic.
   - Set a maximum number of retry attempts.
   - Use exponential backoff between retry attempts to avoid overwhelming the server.
   
2. Enhance error handling and logging:
   - Implement detailed error logging to help diagnose issues.
   - Add specific exception handling for common Playwright errors.

3. Use page load detection:
   - Implement checks to ensure the page is ready for interaction.
   - Use Playwright's `expect` functionality to wait for specific elements to be visible and ready.
   
4. Implement a flexible search input method:
   - Instead of relying on a specific input field, use a more general selector that works across different 
Google layouts.
   - Add a fallback method if the primary search input method fails.

5. Add verification of search results:
   - After performing the search, verify that results are displayed.
   - Capture and log some basic information about the search results (e.g., number of images loaded).
   
6. Implement graceful degradation:
   - If full functionality can\'t be achieved, try to accomplish a simplified version of the task.
   - For example, if interactive search fails, try navigating directly to the Google Images search URL.

7. Useconfiguration options:
   - Allow for customization of timeout durations, retry attempts, and other parameters.
   - This will make the function more flexible for different network conditions and use cases.

We aim to create a reliable and robust search function that can handle various edge cases and provide feedback about the search process and results.
